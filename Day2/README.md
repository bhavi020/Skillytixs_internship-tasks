# Day 2 - Task 2  

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook **`Task2_Day2.ipynb`**, which is part of the daily learning and implementation exercises. The notebook is focused on applying data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis techniques to better understand datasets and prepare them for further modeling. The purpose of this task is to build strong foundations in handling raw data, exploring its characteristics, and performing transformations that are necessary before moving on to advanced machine learning or deep learning algorithms.  

## 📌 Objective  
The main goal of this notebook is to:  
1. Import and explore datasets effectively.  
2. Apply preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
3. Perform data transformations to make the dataset analysis-ready.  
4. Understand the workflow of converting raw datasets into structured and meaningful forms.  

By completing this task, the learner gains practical exposure to real-world issues in datasets, such as unclean data, noise, and redundancy.  

## 🛠️ Steps Performed in the Notebook  
The notebook is organized in a structured way so that it is easy to follow:  

- **Data Importing**: Importing the dataset into the notebook using Python libraries such as Pandas.  
- **Data Exploration**: Checking the number of rows, columns, datatypes, and basic statistics of the dataset.  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Identifying missing values and handling them.  
  - Removing duplicate entries.  
  - Correcting inconsistent values such as categorical mismatches.  
- **Transformation**: Applying renaming of columns, type casting, or scaling if required.  
- **Final Dataset**: Saving the clean and processed dataset for further analysis or modeling.  

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used  
The following Python libraries are used throughout the notebook:  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (if applied): For visualization of trends and missing data patterns.  

These tools form the foundation of modern data analysis and are essential for every data science workflow.  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
- Practical experience in cleaning real datasets.  
- Hands-on knowledge of Pandas functions and preprocessing methods.  
- Understanding the importance of preparing data before feeding it into models.  
- Awareness of common challenges in datasets such as missing values, incorrect formats, or duplicates.
